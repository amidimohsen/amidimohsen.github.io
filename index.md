    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>My name is Mohsen Amidzadeh. I have been a researcher with 9+ years experience in the academic environment. I have finished my master degree at Sharif University of Technology, working on application of particle filter for robust tracking, and obtained my PhD degree at Aalto University working on edge caching via stochastic geometry.
    At the moment, I am a post-doctoral researcher working on projects dealing with new models and theory for reinforcement learning and stochastic control.
    I am eager for challenges requiring a strong mathematical background such as stochastic optimization, optimal control theory, reinforcement learning, signal processing, and estimation theory. My research develops theory and algorithms at the intersection of reinforcement learning and stochastic control, with a focus on forward-backward dynamics.</p>

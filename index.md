## Welcome

I am Mohsen Amidzadeh. I have been a researcher with 9+ years experience in the academic environment. I am so eager for challenges requiring the mathematical 
background such as stochastic optimization, optimal control theory, reinforcement learning, signal processing, 
estimation theory. I can work independently, have problem-solving mindset, am eager to learn and try new ideas, and solving 
problems using a different way than conventional. At the moment, my research develops theory and algorithms at the 
intersection of reinforcement learning and stochastic control, with a focus on forward-backward dynamics.

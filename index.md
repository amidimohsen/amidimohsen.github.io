    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher with over nine years of experience in academic research. My work focuses on developing new models and theory at the intersection of reinforcement learning and stochastic control, particularly for problems involving forward-backward dynamics.</p>
    <p>I earned my PhD from Aalto University, where my research centered on edge caching in wireless networks using stochastic geometry. Before that, I completed my Master's degree at Sharif University of Technology, focusing on robust object tracking with particle filters.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about tackling challenges that demand a strong mathematical foundation in areas like stochastic optimization, optimal control, signal processing, and estimation theory.</p>
    <p> If <span class="date">you</span> are interested in any of my research interest tgrough my ongoing projects, do not hesitate and contact me for a possible <span class="date">collaboration<\span>.</p>

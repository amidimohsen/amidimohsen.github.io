# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Forward-Backward Markov Decision Processes
In this project, the notion of forward-backward Markov decision processes (FB-MDPs) is introduced, for the first time, and its application has been studied.
We develop new RL theory for this project, and devise nolve bidirectional learning algorithm sitable to FB-MDPs.
We also discover the connection between FB-MDPs and forward-backward stochastic differentil equations.
